## 1.	UFO Overview of the analysis

The objective of the challenge is to improve the webpage allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Also, to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## 2.	Results

First all, this is the first picture of the webpage, where is possible to see all the data retrieve from the data.js file.

Secondly, it is possible to see the different searching filters, such as date, city, state, country and shape. The user may type the date, city, state, country and shape as his/her convenience to retrieve the requested data. In this first example, it was searched the data by State, the website retrieves all the data by the state of California.

The next example addresses the search by city, as the picture shows, the name of the city was type as: el cajon and the webpage retrieves the data for that specific city.

Subsequently the user may perform searches even more specific, such as: by state and shape, as follows:

## 3. Summary

3.1 Opportunity Areas

- The user must type all the name of each of the filters.
- There is not a “clean search” button.

3.2	recommendations 

- I would recommend adding one more filter for the duration of the event. 
- To allow to upload and/or retrieve pictures of the events. 
- To add a dropdown list for each of the filters
